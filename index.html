    <h1>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</h1>
    
    <h2>SCORING</h2>
    <h3>The 10 point must system is defined as follows:</h3>
    <p>
        All bouts will be evaluated and scored by three judges. The 10-Point Must System will be the standard system
        of scoring a bout. Under the 10-Point Must Scoring System, 10 points must be awarded to the winner of the
        round and nine points or less must be awarded to the loser, except for an even round, which is scored (10-10).
    </p>
    <h3>**** as of 2022 Unified Rules ****</h3>
    <p>
        Effective Striking/Grappling shall be considered the first priority of round assessments. Effective
        Aggressiveness is a ‘Plan B’ and should not be considered unless the judge does not see ANY advantage in
        the Effective Striking/Grappling realm. Cage/Ring Control (‘Plan C’) should only be needed when ALL other
        criteria are 100% even for both competitors. This will be an extremely rare occurrence.
    </p>
    <h2>PRIORITIZED CRITERIA</h2>
    <h3>Effective Striking/Grappling</h3>
    <p>
        “Legal blows that have immediate or cumulative impact with the potential to contribute towards the end of the
        match with the IMMEDIATE weighing in more heavily than the cumulative impact. Successful execution of
        takedowns, submission attempts, reversals and the achievement of advantageous positions that produce
        immediate or cumulative impact with the potential to contribute to the end of the match, with the IMMEDIATE
        weighing more heavily than the cumulative impact.” It shall be noted that a successful takedown is not merely a
        changing of position, but the establishment of an attack from the use of the takedown. Top and bottom position
        fighters are assessed more on the impactful/effective result of their actions, more so than their position. This
        criterion will be the deciding factor in a high majority of decisions when scoring a round. The next two criteria
        must be treated as a backup and used ONLY when Effective Striking/Grappling is 100% equal for the round.
    </p>
    <h3>Effective Aggressiveness</h3>
    <p>
        “Aggressively making attempts to finish the fight. The key term is ‘effective’. Chasing after an opponent with no
        effective result or impact should not render in the judges’ assessments.” Effective Aggressiveness is only to be
        assessed if Effective Striking/Grappling is 100% equal for both competitors.
    </p>
    <h3>Fighting Area Control</h3>
    <p>
        “Fighting area control is assessed by determining who is dictating the pace, place and position of the match.”
        Fighting Area Control” shall only to be assessed if Effective Striking/Grappling and Effective Aggressiveness is
        100% equal for both competitors. This will be assessed very rarely.
    </p>
    <h2>ROUND SCORING</h2>
    <h3>10–10 Round</h3>
    <p>
        “A 10 – 10 round in MMA is when both fighters have competed for whatever duration of time in the round and
        there is no difference or advantage between either fighter.” A 10 – 10 round in MMA should be extremely rare
        and is not a score to be used as an excuse by a judge that cannot assess the differences in the round. A 10 –
        10 round in MMA is a necessity to have for the judge’s possible score, mainly due to scoring incomplete
        rounds. It is possible to have a round where both fighters engage for 5 minutes and at the end of the 5-minute
        time period the output, impact, effectiveness and overall competition between the two fighters is exactly the
        same. It is possible, but highly unlikely. If there is any discernable difference between the two fighters during
        the round the judge shall not give the score of 10 – 10. Again, this score will be extremely rare.
    </p>
    <h3>10–9 Round</h3>
    <p>
        “A 10 – 9 Round in MMA is where one combatant wins the round by a close margin.” A 10 – 9 round in MMA is
        the most common score a judge assesses during the night. If, during the round, the judge sees a fighter land
        the better strikes, or utilize effective grappling during the competition, even if by just one technique over their
        opponent, the judge shall give the winning fighter a score of 10 while assessing the losing fighter a score of 9
        or less. It is imperative that judges understand that a score of 9 is not an automatic numerical score given to
        the losing fighter of the round. The judge must consider: Was the fighter engaged in offensive actions during
        the round? Did the losing fighter compete with an attitude of attempting to win the fight, or just to survive the
        offensive actions of their opponent? A score of 10 – 9 can reflect an extremely close round or a round of
        marginal domination and/or impact.
    </p>
    <h3>10–8 Round</h3>
    <p>
        A 10 – 8 Round in MMA is where one fighter wins the round by a large margin. A 10 – 8 round in MMA is not
        the most common score a judge will render, but it is absolutely essential to the evolution of the sport and the
        fairness to the fighters that judges understand and effectively utilize the score of 10 – 8. A score of 10 – 8 does
        not require a fighter to dominate their opponent for 5 minutes of a round. The score of 10 – 8 is utilized by the
        judge when the judge sees verifiable actions on the part of either fighter. Judges shall ALWAYS give a score of
        10 – 8 when the judge has established that one fighter has dominated the action of the round, had duration of
        the domination and also impacted their opponent with either effective strikes or effective grappling maneuvers
        that have diminished the abilities of their opponent. Judges must CONSIDER giving the score of 10 – 8 when a
        fighter shows dominance in the round even though no impactful scoring against the opponent was achieved.
        MMA is an offensive based sport. No scoring is given for defensive maneuvers. Using smart, tactically sound
        defensive maneuvers allows the fighter to stay in the fight and to be competitive. Dominance of a round can be
        seen in striking when the losing fighter continually attempts to defend, with no counters or reaction taken when
        openings present themselves. Dominance in the grappling phase can be seen by fighters taking DOMINANT
        POSITIONS in the fight and utilizing those positions to attempt fight ending submissions or attacks. If a fighter
        has little to no offensive output during a 5 minute round, it should be normal for the judge to consider awarding
        the losing fighter 8 points instead of 9. Judges must CONSIDER giving the score of 10 – 8 when a fighter
        IMPACTS their opponent significantly in a round even though they do not dominate the action. Effectiveness in
        striking or grappling which leads to a diminishing of a fighter’s energy, confidence, abilities and spirit. All of
        these come as a direct result of negative impact. When a fighter is hurt with strikes, showing a lack of control
        or ability, these can be defining moments in the fight. If a judge sees that a fighter has been significantly
        damaged in the round the judge should CONSIDER the score of 10 – 8.
    </p>
    <h3>10–7 Round</h3>
    <p>
        “A 10 – 7 Round in MMA is when a fighter completely overwhelms their opponent in Effective Striking and/or
        Grappling and stoppage is warranted.” A 10 – 7 round in MMA is a score that judges will rarely give. It takes
        both overwhelming DOMINANCE of a round, but also significant IMPACT that, at times, cause the judge to
        consider that the fight could be stopped. Judges shall look for multiple IMPACTFUL blows or knockdowns that
        diminish the fighter, and/or grappling maneuvers that place the fighter in dominant situations with impact being
        inflicted that visibly diminishes the fighter’s ability to compete.
    </p>
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
        A judge shall assess if a fighter impacts their opponent significantly in the round, even though they may not
        have dominated the action. Impact includes visible evidence such as swelling and lacerations. Impact shall
        also be assessed when a fighter’s actions, using striking and/or grappling, lead to a diminishing of their
        opponents’ energy, confidence, abilities and spirit. All of these come as a direct result of impact. When a fighter
        is impacted with strikes, by lack of control and/or ability, this can create defining moments in the round and
        shall be assessed with great value.
    </p>
    <h3>Dominance</h3>
    <p>
        As MMA is an offensive based sport, dominance of a round can be seen in striking when the losing fighter is
        forced to continually defend, with no counters or reaction taken when openings present themselves.
        Dominance in the grappling phase can be seen by fighters taking dominant positions in the fight and utilizing
        those positions to attempt fight ending submissions or attacks. Merely holding a dominant position(s) shall not
        be a primary factor in assessing dominance. What the fighter does with those positions is what must be
        assessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the absence of dominance in the grappling phase, as set forth in paragraph 3 of the promulgated rules, to be
        considered dominate, there must be a singularly or in combination, some types of submission attempts, strikes,
        or an overwhelming pace which is measured by improved or aggressive positional changes that cause the
        losing fighter to consistently be in a defensive or reactive mode
    </p>
    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>
        Duration is defined by the time spent by one fighter effectively attacking, controlling and impacting their
        opponent; while the opponent offers little to no offensive output. A judge shall assess duration by recognizing
        the relative time in a round when one fighter takes and maintains full control of the effective offense. This can
        be assessed both standing and grounded.
